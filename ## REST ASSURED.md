## REST ASSURED

## 1 What is rest assured

Rest Assured is a Java-based library used for automating RESTful API testing. It provides a simple and readable syntax for sending HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and validating responses without needing to write complex code. It’s built on top of Java and integrates easily with tools like Maven, TestNG, and Jenkins, which makes it suitable for CI/CD pipelines


In my project, we used Rest Assured to validate backend APIs. It helped us automate test cases for both positive and negative scenarios — for example, verifying response status codes, headers, response body, and JSON schema validation.
We also parameterized test data using TestNG DataProviders, and integrated Rest Assured scripts with Jenkins for continuous testing after each deployment.
It’s especially useful because it works seamlessly with JSONPath and XMLPath, which makes it easy to extract and validate data from API responses.

| **Language**       | Built in **Java** (can integrate with frameworks like TestNG, Cucumber)                        |
| **Supports**       | Both **REST** and **SOAP** (partially) APIs                                                    |
| **Libraries used** | Uses **Apache HTTP Client**, **Hamcrest**, **JSONPath**, **XMLPath** internally                |
| **Validation**     | Assertions can be written using **Hamcrest matchers** (like `equalTo`, `containsString`, etc.) |
| **Integration**    | Works with **Postman**, **Jenkins**, **Maven**, and **GitHub** for CI/CD pipelines             |
| **Reporting**      | Can be combined with **Extent Reports**, **Allure Reports**, or **TestNG reports**             |
