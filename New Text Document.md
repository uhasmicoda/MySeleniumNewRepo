**1 Git**



**Git is a distributed version control system. Itâ€™s mainly used to track changes in code, manage different versions of a project, and allow multiple people to work on the same codebase at the same time without conflicts.**



**GitHub is a cloud-based platform built on top of Git. It provides a place where we can store our code repositories online, collaborate with team members, review code through pull requests, and manage issues or tasks. Basically, Git is the version control system, and GitHub is the platform that makes collaboration and project management easier**



**Git is a distributed version control system that we use to manage our code. In my projects, we used Git with platforms like GitHub. Whenever we worked on a new feature or bug fix, we created separate branches, and once the work was done, we merged them into the main branch through pull requests. During this process, I also handled conflicts when multiple people worked on the same files. Git helped us keep track of changes, roll back if something went wrong, and made collaboration between developers and testers much easier.**
