**APPIUM NOTES**



**What is Appium explain**



**Appium is an open-source mobile automation testing tool that is used to test mobile applications (Native, Hybrid, and Mobile Web apps) on both Android and iOS platforms.**

**It works on the principle of "Write once, run anywhere", which means the same test script can be executed on different devices and platforms without changing the code.**





**2 Appium architecture**



**In my experience, Appium follows a client-server architecture that allows us to automate mobile applications across different platforms. At the top, we have the test scripts, which are written using Appium client libraries in languages like Java, Python, or JavaScript. These client libraries act as a bridge, converting our test commands into JSON requests over HTTP, following the WebDriver protocol.**



**Once the request is created, it is sent to the Appium Server, which is a Node.js application. The server acts like a middle layer — it doesn’t execute commands directly but instead translates them into platform-specific instructions. Based on the target device, Appium chooses the correct automation engine: for example, UIAutomator2 or Espresso for Android, and XCUITest for iOS. These automation engines are provided by Google and Apple themselves, and they have direct access to the operating system and mobile apps.**



**Finally, the automation engine communicates with the real device or emulator/simulator to perform actions such as clicking a button, typing into a text box, or swiping on the screen. Once the action is executed, the response is passed back from the device → to the automation engine → through the Appium Server → and finally returned to the test script.**



**This layered structure makes Appium highly flexible and platform-independent. Just like Selenium for browsers, Appium provides the same “write once, run anywhere” benefit for mobile apps, meaning the same test script can be reused across Android and iOS with minimal changes.**

**| Test Script (Client)    | `driver.findElement(By.id("login")).click();` | QA’s test steps written in code.             | Script written in Java/Python/JS that defines automation steps.                   |**

**| Appium Client Libraries | Java / Python / JS client libraries        | Translate test steps to WebDriver commands.  | Convert method calls into JSON over HTTP (WebDriver protocol).                    |**

**| Appium Server (Node.js) | `appium` (CLI)                             | Middle layer between script and device.      | Receives JSON requests, parses them, and forwards to automation engine.           |**

**| Automation Engines      | Android → UIAutomator2, Espresso<br>iOS → XCUITest | Brain that talks to OS \& app.                | Platform-specific frameworks that execute automation commands on the device.      |**

**| Mobile Device (Target)  | Real device / Emulator / Simulator         | Where the app actually runs.                 | Executes commands (tap, type, scroll) on the app and produces results.            |**

**| Response Backflow       | Response JSON                              | Sends results back to script.                | Device → Engine → Appium Server → Client → Test script (success/failure/results). |**
