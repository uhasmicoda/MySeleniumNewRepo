**## 1 INTRODUCTION**



**Hi / Good morning / afternoon / evening,**



**I’m MD Saddam. I’m currently based in Bangalore, and my roots are in Dhanbad, Jharkhand. I have 3.1 years of experience in the IT industry as a Software Test Engineer.**



**I have recently worked on a major project called the Purple application, which belongs to the e-commerce domain. In this project, I was primarily responsible for mobile automation testing and web automation, focusing on ensuring the application’s overall performance, stability, and functionality.**



**In mobile automation, I automated the Android application using Appium with Java. I also used ADB commands to interact with real devices, capture logs, and simulate different network conditions. I worked on writing and executing test scripts for key modules such as login, search, add to cart, address management, and the complete order flow.**



**In web automation, I was involved in writing and executing test scripts using Selenium WebDriver with Java and TestNG. I automated important modules such as user login, product listings, categories, cart, and wishlist.**



**Along with automation, I have strong experience in manual testing, which includes understanding requirements, writing and executing test cases, logging defects, and verifying bug fixes. I focused on testing the application from an end-user perspective to ensure functionality, usability, and interface behavior work as expected.**



**I am always eager to learn new tools and technologies to improve my technical skills, and I stay focused on delivering high-quality products within specified timelines while continuing to grow in my career.**





**## 2 PROJECT EXPLAINATION-3**



**I worked on the Purplle project, an e-commerce platform in the beauty and cosmetics segment, for about 13 months. The application provides mobile and web interfaces for users to conveniently browse and purchase beauty and personal care products, offering features like product search, filtering, secure payments, cart and wishlist management, order tracking, and personalized recommendations.**



**My role involved manual testing, mobile testing, and supporting automation. I designed and executed test cases for critical flows such as login, product search and filtering, cart and wishlist operations, order placement and cancellation, payment processing, and address management. I also validated UI responsiveness and consistency across different Android devices and screen sizes.**



**During testing, I identified critical defects including app crashes during scrolling, filter reset issues, unresponsive Add to Cart functionality, and OTP-related problems. By thoroughly testing and collaborating with developers, I ensured the application was stable, reliable, and delivered a smooth and engaging shopping experience to users.**





**## 3 PROJECT EXPLAINATION-2**



**I worked on the Busuu project, which is an EdTech platform focused on language learning, for around 29 months. The application provides a user-friendly mobile and web interface for learning international languages such as English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese. It consists of multiple modules, including User Management, Courses and Lessons, Progress Tracking, Vocabulary Builder, Live Interaction, Certification, Offline Access, and Notifications.**



**My role involved manual testing, web testing, and supporting mobile automation using Appium. I was responsible for understanding requirements, designing and executing test cases, and validating key user flows such as login, course selection, lesson completion, progress tracking, vocabulary practice, certificate downloads, and notifications. I performed smoke, functional, integration, regression, UI, and negative testing across both mobile and web platforms, and I validated functionality and UI behavior across different browsers.**



**I actively participated in Agile ceremonies, including daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives, and logged defects in JIRA. During testing, I identified critical issues such as lesson content loading failures, audio playback problems, application crashes, and progress synchronization errors, and worked closely with developers to resolve them.**



**By performing thorough testing on real Android devices and emulators, I helped ensure that the application was stable, reliable, and met business expectations.**



**## 4 Roles and Responsibility**



**I closely worked in an Agile environment, where I actively participated in all Agile ceremonies like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.\*\***







**I made sure to understand the project requirements, user stories clearly and manual test cases so that I could plan and prioritize my testing activities effectively within each sprint and to get clarity over functionality.**







**I was actively involved in the script development process by analyzing manual test cases and functional requirements. Based on that, I designed and executed test scripts to ensure coverage of key business areas, scenarios and functionality.**



**I also maintained a Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) to ensure that all the test cases were properly mapped to the corresponding requirements. This helped in tracking test case coverage and ensured that no requirement was left untested.**



**I was contributing in creating and maintaining POM (Page Object Model) classes to store web elements in a centralized object repository, which helped in improving code reusability and maintainability in our automation framework.**



**I ensured all test scripts were executed and validated locally for accuracy and correctness before adding them to the shared automation framework for further execution.**



**If a valid defect was identified during local execution, I analyzed the issue thoroughly and logged it in JIRA with complete details including steps to reproduce, screenshots, and logs. As a Test Engineer, my goal was to ensure that every defect was clearly documented and visible to the entire team for quick understanding and resolution**



**I was involved in retesting for resolved defects and executing regression test suites to ensure the overall stability and functionality of the application after code changes.\*\***



**I used Git commands to manage all our automation scripts. I regularly committed changes, I worked on separate branches for new feature testing, and my code get merged after proper review. This helped our team to collaborate efficiently without overwriting each other’s work.**



**I’ve used Maven commands to run our test suites, mainly during regression cycles and before releases. It helped us ensure the application was stable and to make sure everything is working fine and to catch bugs early.**



**I was involved in debugging process of the failed test scripts by checking logs, screenshots, and error messages. I fixed issues in scripts like broken locators or synchronizations.**



**I also collaborated with developers to confirm whether the issue was due to a script error or an actual defect in the application.**



**I also used breakpoints and step-by-step execution in the IDE to trace the flow of the test script,**







**\*\*CHALLENGES\*\***



**\*\*What are the automation challenges you faced in your previous project\*\***







**\*\*In my 3.5 years of experience, I’ve faced several challenges during automation testing that helped me grow technically. One of the common issues was when the requirements kept changing. This made it hard to plan test cases in advance. I also faced bugs that didn’t always happen—like they appeared once and then never again. These were hard to reproduce and took extra time to investigate and raised.\*\***







**\*\*One technical challenge I faced was synchronization issues, where elements took time to load and caused test failures. To handle this, I implemented implicit waits for global delays, explicit waits for specific conditions, and custom waits for dynamic content. This helped improve the stability and reliability of our automation scripts.\*\***





**\*\*At one point, I  faced tool version compatibility issues — for example, after upgrading the browser or WebDriver, some scripts started failing due to mismatches between the browser version, Selenium WebDriver, and dependencies. To fix this, we ensured all tools and libraries were compatible, updated the required versions in the pom.xml, and used WebDriverManager to handle driver versions dynamically. This helped restore stability and avoided manual driver setup issues.\*\***







**\*\*One of the challenges I faced was dealing with dynamic elements whose attributes like IDs or classes changed frequently, leading to script failures. To overcome this, I avoided direct static locators and instead used stable strategies like relative XPath and CSS selectors. I also applied advanced XPath axes such as ancestor, descendant, parent, child, and sibling to locate elements based on their relationship with nearby stable elements. This approach helped me build more robust and maintainable test scripts, especially for pages with complex or dynamic DOM structures.\*\***







**\*\*Apart from that, I regularly worked under tight deadlines, so that's why I had to prioritize testing and focus on critical areas first. Also, sometimes I had to clearly explain the impact of a bug to developers to make them understand why it needed to be fixed. Good communication really helped in such cases. These challenges taught me to stay flexible, improve communication, and manage my time better during testing.\*\***







**\*\*Sometimes developers and testers had different understanding of a feature. A developer might developed implement a feature with a certain logic in mind, but the tester might expect it to behave differently based on their understanding of the requirements. This caused chaos confusion and delays. What lessened I have acquired that If I'm having any sort of confusion but learned to ask questions early, get clear understanding, and keep proper documentation to avoid such gaps.\*\***
