**## 1 INTRODUCTION**



**Hi / Good morning / afternoon / evening,**



**I’m MD Saddam. I’m currently based in Bangalore, and my roots are in Dhanbad, Jharkhand. I have 3.1 years of experience in the IT industry as a Software Test Engineer.**



**I have recently worked on a major project called the Purple application, which belongs to the e-commerce domain. In this project, I was primarily responsible for mobile automation testing and web automation, focusing on ensuring the application’s overall performance, stability, and functionality.**



**In mobile automation, I automated the Android application using Appium with Java. I also used ADB commands to interact with real devices, capture logs, and simulate different network conditions. I worked on writing and executing test scripts for key modules such as login, search, add to cart, address management, and the complete order flow.**



**In web automation, I was involved in writing and executing test scripts using Selenium WebDriver with Java and TestNG. I automated important modules such as user login, product listings, categories, cart, and wishlist.**



**Along with automation, I have strong experience in manual testing, which includes understanding requirements, writing and executing test cases, logging defects, and verifying bug fixes. I focused on testing the application from an end-user perspective to ensure functionality, usability, and interface behavior work as expected.**



**I am always eager to learn new tools and technologies to improve my technical skills, and I stay focused on delivering high-quality products within specified timelines while continuing to grow in my career.**





**## 2 PROJECT EXPLAINATION-3**



**The most recent project I worked on is Purplle, which belongs to the e-commerce domain, specifically in the beauty and cosmetics segment. I worked on this project for around 13 months.**



**The main objective of the Purplle application was to provide a convenient and user-friendly platform for customers to purchase beauty and personal care products through mobile and web applications. The goal was to enhance the overall shopping experience, increase market reach, and improve customer engagement.**



**The application was divided into multiple modules, each focusing on a specific functionality to improve the end-user experience.**



**The User Module handled registration and login using mobile number and OTP authentication, along with profile management.**

**The Product Module allowed users to browse products with detailed information such as images, pricing, availability, and reviews.**

**The Categories and Brands Module helped users filter and search products based on categories like skincare, haircare, and makeup, as well as by brand.**

**The Cart and Wishlist Module enabled users to add, remove, and save items for future purchases.**

**The Order Module managed order placement, tracking, and cancellation.**

**The Address and Payment Module handled address management, current location selection, and supported multiple payment options such as UPI, cards, net banking, wallets, and cash on delivery.**

**The Offers and Promotions Module included applying promo codes and displaying available discounts.**

**The Settings and Notifications Module allowed users to manage preferences, privacy settings, and receive order-related notifications.**



**Overall, the application supported features like product search, filtering, secure payments, order tracking, profile management, personalized recommendations, frequent offers, and real-time order updates.**



**From a testing perspective, the client’s key expectations were application stability, visual appeal, and compatibility across multiple devices to ensure a smooth user experience.**



**We followed the Agile methodology, working in sprints and participating in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives. I worked extensively on manual testing, mobile testing, and automation support, executing smoke, functional, integration, regression, UI, and negative test scenarios.**



**I tested critical user flows such as login, product search, filtering, cart and wishlist operations, order placement and cancellation, payment flows, and address management. I also validated UI consistency and responsiveness across different screen sizes and Android versions.**



**During testing, I identified and reported multiple critical defects such as application crashes during scrolling, issues with filters not resetting properly, unresponsive Add to Cart functionality, and OTP-related issues on certain devices. Through thorough testing and defect validation, we ensured the application met business requirements and delivered a reliable shopping experience to users.**
