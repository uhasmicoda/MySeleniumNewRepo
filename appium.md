What is Appium explain

Appium is an open-source mobile automation testing tool that is used to test mobile applications (Native, Hybrid, and Mobile Web apps) on both Android and iOS platforms.
It works on the principle of "Write once, run anywhere", which means the same test script can be executed on different devices and platforms without changing the code.


2 Appium architecture

In my experience, Appium follows a client-server architecture that allows us to automate mobile applications across different platforms. At the top, we have the test scripts, which are written using Appium client libraries in languages like Java, Python, or JavaScript. These client libraries act as a bridge, converting our test commands into JSON requests over HTTP, following the WebDriver protocol.

Once the request is created, it is sent to the Appium Server, which is a Node.js application. The server acts like a middle layer ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt execute commands directly but instead translates them into platform-specific instructions. Based on the target device, Appium chooses the correct automation engine: for example, UIAutomator2 or Espresso for Android, and XCUITest for iOS. These automation engines are provided by Google and Apple themselves, and they have direct access to the operating system and mobile apps.

Finally, the automation engine communicates with the real device or emulator/simulator to perform actions such as clicking a button, typing into a text box, or swiping on the screen. Once the action is executed, the response is passed back from the device ‚Üí to the automation engine ‚Üí through the Appium Server ‚Üí and finally returned to the test script.

This layered structure makes Appium highly flexible and platform-independent. Just like Selenium for browsers, Appium provides the same ‚Äúwrite once, run anywhere‚Äù benefit for mobile apps, meaning the same test script can be reused across Android and iOS with minimal changes.

| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Test Script (Client)    | Test cases written by QA using Appium client libraries in Java, Python, JavaScript, etc.                    | `driver.findElement(By.id("login")).click();`       |
| Appium Client Libraries | Converts test commands into JSON over HTTP requests following the WebDriver protocol.                       | Acts as a bridge between script and server.         |
| Appium Server (Node.js) | Receives JSON requests from client, translates them into platform-specific commands.                        | Runs on Node.js, works like a middle layer.         |
| Automation Engines      | Platform-specific automation frameworks that interact directly with the OS and app.                         | Android ‚Üí UIAutomator2, Espresso; iOS ‚Üí XCUITest    |
| Mobile Device (Target)  | Real device, emulator, or simulator where the app is installed. Executes the commands and returns response. | Android phone, iPhone, or emulator/simulator        |
| Response Backflow       | Result of action is passed back ‚Üí Device ‚Üí Engine ‚Üí Appium Server ‚Üí Client script.                          | Example: Button click success, text retrieved, etc. |

Appium prerequisites

To set up Appium for Android automation, a few prerequisites are required. First, we need the Java Development Kit (JDK), since Appium scripts are often written in Java and Android SDK tools depend on it. An IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VS Code is required to write and manage automation scripts. Since Appium is built on top of Node.js, we must install Node.js to run the Appium server. The Appium server (Appium Desktop) acts as a middleware that translates our client commands into mobile actions. Along with this, we need the Appium drivers, such as UiAutomator2 (default for Android), which actually interacts with the Android device. For running tests, we need either a real Android device or an emulator created from Android Studio. To inspect app elements and get locators, we use Appium Inspector. Finally, Android Studio is essential because it provides the Android SDK, emulator, and ADB tools, which are mandatory for device communication and automation.
