## 1 What is Appium explain

Appium is an open-source mobile automation testing tool that is used to test mobile applications (Native, Hybrid, and Mobile Web apps) on both Android and iOS platforms.
It works on the principle of "Write once, run anywhere", which means the same test script can be executed on different devices and platforms without changing the code.


## 2 Appium architecture

In my experience, Appium follows a client-server architecture that allows us to automate mobile applications across different platforms. At the top, we have the test scripts, which are written using Appium client libraries in languages like Java, Python, or JavaScript. These client libraries act as a bridge, converting our test commands into JSON requests over HTTP, following the WebDriver protocol.

Once the request is created, it is sent to the Appium Server, which is a Node.js application. The server acts like a middle layer ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt execute commands directly but instead translates them into platform-specific instructions. Based on the target device, Appium chooses the correct automation engine: for example, UIAutomator2 or Espresso for Android, and XCUITest for iOS. These automation engines are provided by Google and Apple themselves, and they have direct access to the operating system and mobile apps.

Finally, the automation engine communicates with the real device or emulator/simulator to perform actions such as clicking a button, typing into a text box, or swiping on the screen. Once the action is executed, the response is passed back from the device ‚Üí to the automation engine ‚Üí through the Appium Server ‚Üí and finally returned to the test script.

This layered structure makes Appium highly flexible and platform-independent. Just like Selenium for browsers, Appium provides the same ‚Äúwrite once, run anywhere‚Äù benefit for mobile apps, meaning the same test script can be reused across Android and iOS with minimal changes.

| Layer / Component       | Description                                                                                                 | Example / Role                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Test Script (Client)    | Test cases written by QA using Appium client libraries in Java, Python, JavaScript, etc.                    | `driver.findElement(By.id("login")).click();`       |
| Appium Client Libraries | Converts test commands into JSON over HTTP requests following the WebDriver protocol.                       | Acts as a bridge between script and server.         |
| Appium Server (Node.js) | Receives JSON requests from client, translates them into platform-specific commands.                        | Runs on Node.js, works like a middle layer.         |
| Automation Engines      | Platform-specific automation frameworks that interact directly with the OS and app.                         | Android ‚Üí UIAutomator2, Espresso; iOS ‚Üí XCUITest    |
| Mobile Device (Target)  | Real device, emulator, or simulator where the app is installed. Executes the commands and returns response. | Android phone, iPhone, or emulator/simulator        |
| Response Backflow       | Result of action is passed back ‚Üí Device ‚Üí Engine ‚Üí Appium Server ‚Üí Client script.                          | Example: Button click success, text retrieved, etc. |

## 3 Appium prerequisites

To set up Appium for Android automation, a few prerequisites are required. First, we need the Java Development Kit (JDK), since Appium scripts are often written in Java and Android SDK tools depend on it. An IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VS Code is required to write and manage automation scripts. Since Appium is built on top of Node.js, we must install Node.js to run the Appium server. The Appium server (Appium Desktop) acts as a middleware that translates our client commands into mobile actions. Along with this, we need the Appium drivers, such as UiAutomator2 (default for Android), which actually interacts with the Android device. For running tests, we need either a real Android device or an emulator created from Android Studio. To inspect app elements and get locators, we use Appium Inspector. Finally, Android Studio is essential because it provides the Android SDK, emulator, and ADB tools, which are mandatory for device communication and automation.

| Tool / Component                       | Purpose                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JDK (Java Development Kit)**         | Needed to run Appium scripts written in Java and for Android SDK tools.            |
| **IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ / VS Code)** | Where you write and manage your automation scripts.                                |
| **Node.js**                            | Required because **Appium server** is built on Node.js.                            |
| **Appium Server / Appium Desktop**     | The middleware that translates client commands to mobile actions.                  |
| **Appium Drivers**                     | Platform-specific drivers: <br>üëâ Android ‚Üí **UiAutomator2 Driver** / Espresso     |
| **Device (Real / Emulator)**           | The target where tests are executed (real Android phone or Android emulator).      |
| **Appium Inspector**                   | GUI tool to inspect elements and get locators for automation.                      |
| **Android Studio (with SDK & ADB)**    | Provides **SDK tools, Emulator, ADB commands** (mandatory for Android automation). |


## 4 What are Desired Capabilities in Appium?

In Appium, Desired Capabilities are basically a set of key‚Äìvalue pairs that act like instructions for the Appium server, telling it what kind of automation session we want to start. Whenever we write a test script, before executing any action, our client script sends these capabilities to the Appium server in the form of a JSON object. The server then uses this information to launch the right platform, the right device, and the right application. For example, in Android automation, we usually define capabilities such as the platform name, platform version, device name, automation engine (like UiAutomator2), and the details of the application under test such as app package and app activity. Similarly, for iOS we provide capabilities like platform name, platform version, device UDID, automation engine (like XCUITest), and the bundle ID of the app. Desired Capabilities make the framework flexible because by changing these values we can run the same test scripts on different devices, OS versions, or even on real devices and emulators without changing the core logic of our test. In short, they act as the bridge between our test scripts and the mobile environment by defining all the necessary configurations for a successful session.


```java
DesiredCapabilities caps = new DesiredCapabilities();

// Platform & Device details
caps.setCapability("platformName", "Android");          // Mobile OS
caps.setCapability("platformVersion", "13.0");          // Android version
caps.setCapability("deviceName", "Pixel_5");            // Emulator/Real device name
caps.setCapability("automationName", "UiAutomator2");   // Automation engine

// Application details
caps.setCapability("appPackage", "com.example.myapp");               // App package name
caps.setCapability("appActivity", "com.example.myapp.MainActivity"); // App launch activity
caps.setCapability("app", "C:\\apps\\myapp.apk");                    // Path to the APK file

// App behavior settings
caps.setCapability("noReset", true);         // Don‚Äôt reset app data between sessions
caps.setCapability("fullReset", false);      // Don‚Äôt uninstall app between sessions
caps.setCapability("autoGrantPermissions", true); // Grant all runtime permissions automatically

// Keyboard settings
caps.setCapability("unicodeKeyboard", true); // Support Unicode input (e.g., Hindi, emojis, etc.)
caps.setCapability("resetKeyboard", true);   // Reset to normal keyboard after test

// Device unlock settings
caps.setCapability("unlockType", "pin");     // Unlock method (pin, pattern, password)
caps.setCapability("unlockKey", "1234");     // Unlock key (your actual PIN/pattern/password)

// Extra configs
caps.setCapability("ignoreHiddenApiPolicyError", true); // Ignore hidden API policy errors
caps.setCapability("newCommandTimeout", 60);            // Timeout (in seconds) for new commands
```

## 5 UiAutomator2Options
UiAutomator2Options is a special class introduced in Appium 2.x under the package io.appium.java_client.android.options. Its main purpose is to define the capabilities of an Android device or emulator in a more structured and type-safe way. Earlier, in Appium 1.x, testers used DesiredCapabilities to pass these values, but the problem was that everything was written as key‚Äìvalue strings (for example, "platformName", "deviceName"). If you made a small spelling mistake in the capability name, the script would fail, and debugging was difficult.

With Appium 2.x, the Appium team introduced the concept of Options classes, such as UiAutomator2Options for Android and XCUITestOptions for iOS. These classes provide dedicated setter methods like setDeviceName(), setAppPackage(), or setAppActivity(). This not only makes the code cleaner and easier to read, but also gives autocomplete suggestions in the IDE, which helps avoid mistakes. For example, instead of writing caps.setCapability("deviceName", "Pixel_5"), now you can simply write options.setDeviceName("Pixel_5").

In simple words, UiAutomator2Options acts like an organized container for all Android-related capabilities. It improves code readability, reduces errors, and aligns with modern Appium standards. That‚Äôs why it is the recommended way to define capabilities in Appium 2.x instead of using the older DesiredCapabilities class.

```java 
import io.appium.java_client.android.options.UiAutomator2Options;

UiAutomator2Options options = new UiAutomator2Options();

// Platform & Device details
options.setPlatformName("Android");           // Mobile OS
options.setPlatformVersion("13.0");           // Android version
options.setDeviceName("Pixel_5");             // Emulator/Real device name
options.setAutomationName("UiAutomator2");    // Automation engine

// Application details
options.setAppPackage("com.example.myapp");                // App package name
options.setAppActivity("com.example.myapp.MainActivity");  // App launch activity
options.setApp("C:\\apps\\myapp.apk");                     // Path to the APK file

// App behavior settings
options.setNoReset(true);                   // Don‚Äôt reset app data between sessions
options.setFullReset(false);                // Don‚Äôt uninstall app between sessions
options.setAutoGrantPermissions(true);      // Grant all runtime permissions automatically

// Keyboard settings
options.setUnicodeKeyboard(true);           // Support Unicode input (e.g., Hindi, emojis, etc.)
options.setResetKeyboard(true);             // Reset to normal keyboard after test

// Device unlock settings
options.setCapability("unlockType", "pin");  // Unlock method (pin, pattern, password)
options.setCapability("unlockKey", "1234");  // Unlock key (your actual PIN/pattern/password)

// Extra configs
options.setCapability("ignoreHiddenApiPolicyError", true); // Ignore hidden API policy errors
options.setNewCommandTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(60));       // Timeout for new commands
